### Hi there 👋

My name is Lemuel, but most people know me as Lemi.

I love building web applications in Python 🐍 with [Django](http://djangoproject.com). I also, very occassionally, take [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) for a spin.

I am also the founder of [Vokality](https://www.github.com/vokality), a software development agency on a mission to equip founders with the technical knowledge, tools and guidance to build, launch and scale their ventures.
